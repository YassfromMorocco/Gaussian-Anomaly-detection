# Gaussian-Anomaly-detection
Method for anomaly detection using normal law

I use this method to detect anomalies from sensor used on vehicle.

Contains:

1 Data preprocessing function
* Compute derivation of the clean x input
* get average, standard deviation and variance
    
2 Gaussian anoamy detection function
* Compute the gaussian probability of the x input to clean
